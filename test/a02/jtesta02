     the deposition profiles for high-energy hydrogen beams are computed by a monte-carlo method, using   20000 test
     particles and   20 zones.  the profiles are (re)computed every time an injector is turned on or off
     every    5 timesteps, and every time the te profile changes by more than 20.00 %, or the mean-free-path
     profile changes by more than 10.00%.
