 ! Neutral beam injection data for TFTR since summer of 1987.
 ! Data from Ken Wright and Larry Grisham at PPPL 22 Aug 1989
 ! There are actually 12 sources arranged into 4 beamlines on TFTR
 ! Here, pairs of sources with the same injection angle have been
 ! grouped together.
 ! Hence, this data set has three co- and three counter-injection sources.
 ! The sources are (1) 1A  (2) 1B  (3) 1C  (4) 5C  (5) 5B  (6) 5A
 ! Sources 2A, 2B, and 2C have the same injection angles as 1A, 1B, 1C
 ! Sources 3A, 3B, and 3C were lumped together with 5A, 5B, and 5C
 ! The actual injection angles (3A) -35.31, (3B) -31.79, (3C) -28.22
 ! for beamline 3 were not used
