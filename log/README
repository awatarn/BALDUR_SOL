   The files in this subdirectory constitute the heart of the BALDUR
code.  Most of the subroutines in these files refer to common blocks
found in .../baldur/code/com.

   First type:

gmake xtverb

in order to compile xtverb from xtverb.f.

   In order to compile any of these files, edit the files as needed,
update the date and time in file labrun.f on line 12, and then type:

gmake

This utility will change the library ../libbald.a
and will then reconsruct the executable ../run/xbaldur

   Note that files with the .tex extension have FORTRAN source code
imbedded in them.  The make utility calls on the application xtverb
to extract the FORTRAN source code from these LaTeX files.
When a .tex file is present, always make changes to it as needed,
and never make changes to the corresponding .f file.

   The lists of dependencies and the rules for compiling are in
.../baldur/code/bald/makefile
