c                - maximum number of sawtooth times is increased to 320
c                - some variables are initialized in dio.f

c rap 1-aug-02  -1- new parameter mj for maximum number of radial zones is introduced.
c                   the parameter is included in new include file cparm.m
c               -2- include files cbaldr.m and commhd.m were changed to use 
c                   new parameter mj: all explicitly specified number of zones, 55, changed to mj
c               -3- all source files were changed; in addition to cbaldr.m and commhd.m,
c                   new file cparm.m is included
c               -4- subroutines mhdini and solveb are changed to allow access to externally provided
c                   netcdf file with q-profiles. New namelist varibale sqprofile, which specified
c                   the name of external netcdf file with qprofile, is introduced. 

c rap 31-jul-02 -1- include statements changed everywhere from 
c                   include '../com/<incfile>' to include '<incfile>'
c               -2- new directories neoclass, mlib, tmodels, sawtooth are
c                   created. The source files, related to neoclassical transport
c                   math libraries, transport models, and sawtooth are moved to that
c                   directories
c               -3- all makefiles are changed and new one created
c               -4- the code was cleaned: functions DIMAG were changed to AIMAG, 
c                   MAX0 to MAX, MIN0 to MIN
c               -5- some used but not initialized variables were initialized
c               -6- utilities used with the baldur code were included in the 
c                   distribution
c               -7- new modules ncprofile_mod and netcdf_output_mod added
c                   to provide an interface with netcdf files
c               -8- utilites list and profile were modified to provide access to the netcdf
c                   files
c               -9- directories bin, lib, data, test, work, mod, obj were created
c               -10- test cases were placed in the directory test
c               -11- new script run.sh to run the buldur code was added
c               -12- NTCC modules portlib and ezcdf were included  
c               -13- include file cbaldr.m was modified to be compartible with the 
c                    Fortran-90 standards; some undeclared varibales were declared
