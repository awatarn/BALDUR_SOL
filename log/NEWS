   Just after a sawtooth crash in tftlrs7u (see for example jl960624f.Z)
the Weiland model routine etaw13 yields different results on f.nersc.gov
and plasma.physics.lehigh.edu.  Near the magnetic axis, the variables
going into etaw13 are identical, but the variables coming out are not.

   I made two important changes on the workstation:
1) setenv XLFRTEOPTS namelist=old
   allows the older style of namelist to be used in jobxdat files
   (Note, this option is now included in the .../baldur/.cshrc file
2) The -1 option has been removed from the .../baldur/code/bald1/makefile
   so that do loops are not executed in cases like: do j=1,0

   The results in jf960624e (run on f.nersc.gov) and jl960624e (run on plasma)
are identical through time-step 5 and then diverge after the first 
sawtooth crash.


20:30 23 June 1996
   Bateman moved the utilities to bald1 and installed them in bald1/makefile
since they were already appearing in libbald.a in any event.

20:00 23 June 1996
   Bateman reinstalled diagnostic printouts in sbrtn mcarlo (file dneugas.f)
and in sbrtn ran2 (file random.f) to test with new data sets.

c  rgb 23-jun-96 compute dvoli(j) from j=1,mjbal-1, not to mjbal
   This change was put in to avoid array out of bounds when using
nzones = 52 in jobxdat.

   A Z_eff monitor is now installed in order to automate the impurity
influxing to match a prescribed volume-averaged Z_eff as a function of
time.  To turn this feature on, set

cfutz(200) = 3.0  ! in the first namelist

ftzeff(jtime) = prescribed Z_eff values at breakpoint times timp(jtime)
  in the second namelist

   The following files have been changed:  preset.f, dio.f, imprad.f,
ncinfl.f and ncsorc.f.  Note that ncinfl.f computes the neutral
impurity influx rate.

   The non-equilibrium impurity radiation package has been improved
in the BALDUR code.  The source code is included in the files
imprad.f, nc*.f, and noncor.f.  To use this package, you need the
following lines in the input data file jobxdat:

   First namelist:

 nbound = 0,         ! prescribed boundary conditions

 natomc = 3,           ! nonequilibrium impurity radiation model
 cfutz(200) = 1.0,     ! impurities influxed as neutrals
 cfutz(201) = 2*1.0,   ! kinetic energy of neutral impurities (keV)
 cfutz(203) = 0.18,    ! energy loss per impurity ionization (keV)
 cfutz(207) = 2*1.0,   ! outermost zone in from ledge allowing ionization
 cfutz(209) = 2*0.90,  ! max penetration depth for neut impurities / a

   Second namelist:

 bdimpe(1,1) = 10*2.50e11, ! impurity edge density as a function of time

   Third namelist:

 $ncodat
 ! impurity radiation namelist
 recflx = 1.0,   ! recycling factor for diffusive losses to the wall
 recscr = 1.0,   ! recycling factor for scrape-off losses
 nwcool = 1100,  ! print local and vol rad power, electron cooling rate
 nwline = 1000,  ! print local and vol rad power, line radiation
 nwioni = 0,     ! ionization losses
 nwreko = 0,     ! recombination radiation
 nwchex = 0,     ! charge exchange radiation
 nwbrem = 0,     ! bremsstrahlung radiation
 $end

   This must be followed by two lines of text, 
the equilibrium namelist, and any reread namelists, as needed.

   Note that when bdimpe has non-zero value in the second namelist,
the distribution of impurity ionization states at the boundary is
set equal to the equilibrium distribution.  If bdimpe is not given,
then the boundary value of the impurity density is given by denim1,
it is fixed in time, and only the first ionization state is filled.

   In this new package, the impurity ionization states are initialized
across the radius by their equilibrium distribution.  Hence there is
no initial burst of impurity radiation and the electron density does
not change very much during the first few steps of the run.

   This package is still being tested and will probably be improved.

   Also, please see the file .../baldur/code/bald/chngs95
for other changes to the source code.

 Added capability for current drive in subroutine solveb.f. This is
 turned on in jobxdat by setting cfutz(499) = 1.0. The current drive
 profile is then inserted in the file 'lhcurr' which must be present
 in the run directory.

 Subroutine 'bounds.f' was corrected, so the variables 'bdtee' and
 'bdtie' correspond to the boundary electron and ion temperatures,
 respectively.

 The Itoh-Itoh current-diffusive ballooning model has been added to
 subroutine THEORY. It is recommended that an empirical transport model
 is used for the particle transport if this model is used.
